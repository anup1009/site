		<h1> My Background</h1>
		<p>
			Belonging to a middle class family, I grew up in the beautiful city of Pokhara lying in the laps of Mt Machhapuchchhre.I grew up facing and seeing the difficulties and struggles of people around me. Those hard fought moments in my life brought me a strong desire to suceed in my life and i am on the way to achieve it.Although being in a middle class family is always tough i didnt face too much problems but was a victim of different racisms and discrimination. The boundaries kept by being a middle class led me to have a great spirit to face any problems ahead and motivates me to try every difficult tasks so that i can achieve what is known as impossible for many others. I had completed my School leaving certificate from Gandaki Higher Secondary Boarding School (GHSBS) which is a very famous school in my country and completed my +2 education from Motherland Secondary School. Now i am currently involved in High school education at Paschimanchal Campus of Tribhuvan University loated in my own city of Pokhara.

		<h1>My Nature</h1>
		<p>
		I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds.I love to see people and animals happy and enjoy. I live my life the way I want. Nothing or no one can influence me as much as this nature does.My nature is reflection of the nature of mother earth as I love to love and I am happy.Just like the rain, my love showers over my dear ones , animals and nature. I am patient, supportive and perservant as this earth patiently supports all creation .No one knows me closely but my dear ones know how much I am full of love and care. If I determine something then nothing can break my determination as I am self motivated person.I don't like to criticize others and don't feel comfortable incase I have to say something that might hurt other person. I am not a very chatty person. I keep my professional and private life separate. I don't like unwanted attention. I don't like when people can't stop dreaming or making assumptions about others. I have a great sense of humour but not many people know. I love to make others laugh .I don't like people who blindly follow anything or anyone. I like people more when they have awareness, awareness about themselves; this is what most people lack, they are so unaware about themselves yet so aware about others. I don't know how are they so aware and confident about others when they don't know themselves properly.I like to be a very positive, supportive and encouraging person. Even my criticism will be constructive feedback for others which will spark the motivation and then they will prepare themselves to improve.I dislike people who run away from hardwork and who take advantage of others.I am individual who doesn't forget kindness in others. I will always remember whatever anyone does for me and always return it back whenever I get such an opportunity.

		<h1>My Works</h1>
		<p>
		I am passionate about my work because I love what I do and I have a steady source of self-motivation that drives me to do my best. In my every work, this dedication led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work every time. I learned how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. I soon became interested in animation designing and studied about the basic animation skills.I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I’m always able to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the team stay on track, too. I’m a people-person.
